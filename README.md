# React CRUD
React JS web application that handles CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).

## What is React JS?
React is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces based on UI components. It is maintained by Meta and a community of individual developers and companies.

### This web app contains the following dependencies:
- `Next.js`: An open-source web development framework created by Vercel enabling React-based web applications with server-side rendering and generating static websites.
- `Typescript`: A free and open source programming language developed and maintained by Microsoft. It is a strict syntactical superset of JavaScript and adds optional static typing to the language. It is designed for the development of large applications and transpiles to JavaScript. 
- `PostgreSQL`: A free and open-source relational database management system emphasizing extensibility and SQL compliance.
- `Prisma`: An ORM (Object-relational mapping) that helps app developers build faster and make fewer errors.
- `Tailwind CSS`: An open source CSS framework. The main feature of this library is that, unlike other CSS frameworks like Bootstrap, it does not provide a series of predefined classes for elements such as buttons or tables.
- `Sass`: A preprocessor scripting language that is interpreted or compiled into Cascading Style Sheets.
